Using the Jupyter Notebook is advised, if for no reason other than so 

If you're having difficulty running the preprocessing, it's probably because your file structure is slightly different. This was hardcoded to use contet/x.csv; you may need /content/x.csv, or content\x.csv, or something of the like. 
If using Google Collaboratory, you need to use /content/x.csv (it is set that way already, it should not need changing). 

Code near the end is simply for graphs. It is not particularly important.
